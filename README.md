# code-template-generator

When i comes to coding.. we have c++ and java and python as well as others... each becoming more adaptable and user friendly.. However still very confusing for non coders and even repetitive for those who do use everyday.. I was thinking of a sort of code template.. this concept will not be universal but user based created... For example.. I have a few code for pixel art processes.. one that turns all images into png.. one that resizes all images over 512 into 512x512... one that can change 16x16 into 32x32 or either way... but also all of these individual code can be run in proper order and as a single code.. if it were one single code I would not know how to break it down into individual code.. So welcome the Code Template. Providing the entire code and it is then analyzed and understood and then produces easy relatable words that are now used to run said script..  I provided 3 running code examples together makes 4.. so as an example the template suggests "this script is done" or it could just be whatever.. "fish tree rock car" so the first word will run the first code, second word the second code. 3rd the 3rd. and the last word will run entire script.  and now whenever you say run this.. or run is. the particular code will run. essentially you can have it setup to run the entire code off just one word as well.. this will streamline the more mundane tasks and even simplify some of the more complex.. Yes dependencies and input/output locations will need to be addresses among other things but im thinking between an add on to an IDE and a python environment most could be considered
